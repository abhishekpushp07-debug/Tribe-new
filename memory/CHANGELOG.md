# Tribe — Changelog

## 2026-03-10: Stage B6 Phase 1 — Reels Polish (PASS)

### Bug Fixes
1. **Moderation call signature fix** — All 3 moderation calls in `reels.js` (create, edit, comment) were using wrong signature `(text, type)` instead of canonical `(db, {object})`. Fixed to use `moderateCreateContent(db, { entityType, entityId, actorUserId, text, metadata })`.
2. **Reel comment accepts both `text` and `body`** — Previously only accepted `text`. Now accepts `body || text` matching post comment canonical behavior. Both fields stored for backward compat.
3. **Reel report safe body parsing** — Added safe JSON parsing with `try/catch` to prevent 500 on empty/malformed body. Returns clear 400 error.
4. **Report response _id leak fix** — Report response now excludes MongoDB `_id` field.

### Enum & Notification Fixes
5. **Added `REEL_LIKE`, `REEL_COMMENT` to NotificationType enum** in `constants.js`. Reel handlers now use `NotificationType.REEL_LIKE` and `NotificationType.REEL_COMMENT` instead of raw strings.

### Files Changed
- `/app/lib/constants.js` — Added REEL_LIKE, REEL_COMMENT to NotificationType
- `/app/lib/handlers/reels.js` — Fixed moderation calls (3 sites), comment input compat, report safe parsing, _id exclusion, NotificationType enum usage

### Tests
- **New**: `/app/tests/handlers/test_b6_reels_polish.py` — 31 tests across 5 groups (Moderation, Comment, Notifications, Report, Regression)
- **Regression**: B3 107/107 PASS, B4 72/72 PASS, B6 31/31 PASS — **Total 210/210 zero regressions**

### Contract Impact
- Reel comment request: NOW accepts `{ text }` OR `{ body }` (backward compatible)
- Reel comment response: NOW includes both `text` and `body` fields (additive)
- NotificationType: Added `REEL_LIKE`, `REEL_COMMENT` (additive, no old type removed)
- Reel report response: _id no longer leaked (safety fix)



## 2026-03-10: Stage FH1-U — Frontend Readiness Gate (PASS)
### Validation
- Full backend discovery: 16 handler files, 150+ routes enumerated from actual code
- All domains validated: auth, profile, media, content, comments, stories, reels, social graph, notifications, tribes, contests, events, governance, pages, B4 features, search
- **633/633 tests passing** (B3 107 + B4 72 + existing 454 = zero regressions)

### Frontend Handoff Pack (7 Docs)
1. **API_REFERENCE.md** — Complete route reference for all 150+ endpoints across 16 domains
2. **SERIALIZER_CONTRACTS.md** — Frozen canonical shapes: UserSnippet, PageSnippet, PostObject, RepostObject, CommentObject, MediaObject, NotificationObject, CollegeSnippet, TribeSnippet, ContestSnippet
3. **SCREEN_TO_ENDPOINT_MAP.md** — 22 frontend screens mapped to exact backend endpoints
4. **STATE_AND_PERMISSIONS.md** — Page role matrix, content visibility, edit/share/like permissions, optimistic UI safety table
5. **NOTIFICATION_EVENT_GUIDE.md** — All 10 notification types with trigger, recipient, deep-link behavior
6. **FE_KNOWN_GOTCHAS.md** — 20 documented edge cases (dual author, avatar resolution, pagination, age gate, repost rendering, etc.)
7. **FRONTEND_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md** — Complete integration guide by domain

### Contract Freeze Status
- All serializer shapes frozen and verified against actual code
- No route drift detected
- No serializer drift detected
- Dual author (USER/PAGE) rendering rules documented
- Repost serializer shape documented

## 2026-03-10: Stage B4 + B4-U — Core Social Gaps (PASS)
### Features Implemented
- **Edit Post Caption** (`PATCH /content/:id`): Owner/page-role edit with moderation re-check, editedAt timestamp, enriched response. B2 ownership + page-role guard.
- **Comment Like/Unlike** (`POST/DELETE /content/:postId/comments/:commentId/like`): Idempotent like/unlike with `commentLikeCount`, B2 parent-content visibility guard, self-notify suppression. Separate `comment_likes` collection with unique index.
- **Share/Repost** (`POST /content/:id/share`): Creates new content_item linked via `originalContentId`. One-repost-per-user-per-original. Cannot repost a repost. B2 visibility/block checks. Original content embedded in serializer. Increment `shareCount` on original.
- **Counter Integration**: commentLikeCount, shareCount — proven exact, idempotent, never-negative.
- **Notification Integration**: COMMENT_LIKE → comment author, SHARE → original author (page-aware for page-owned content). Self-notify suppressed.
- **Serializer/enrichPosts Updated**: Repost items embed `originalContent` with resolved author. `editedAt` exposed on edited posts.
- **Content creation fixed**: User-authored posts now always include `authorType: 'USER'`, `createdAs: 'USER'`.
- **Index setup**: `comment_likes` unique on (userId, commentId), `content_items` sparse on (authorId, originalContentId).

### B4-U Test Gate: PASS
- **72/72 tests passing** across 14 phases
- Covers: routes, edit, comment-like, share/repost, counters, notifications, snapshots, B2 safety, page compat, concurrency, failure/rollback, performance, backward compat, observability

- **Product Smoke Expansion** (2 tests): event lifecycle, resource lifecycle
- **College + House Feed** (10 tests): distributionStage gating, cross-college/house isolation

### Infrastructure Changes
- 7 dedicated test users: test_user, test_user_2, product_user_a/b, resource_user, social_user, admin_user
- Cleanup extended to 20+ collections (events, resources, notices, reels, etc.)

- Reel interactions return `{ message: 'Liked' }` (not `viewerHasLiked`)
- Event creation has 10/hour per-user rate limit
- Notice creation restricted to board members or admin role
